# Python_course
Hi! In this repo I tried to save all of my exercises and experience through my self-learning of coding in Python language.
What source have I used for learning?
- Udemy
  - Cyfrowy_Trener_Course - in Polish language
- Books
  - Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming - in Polish language

That's enough for now. Enjoy reading!
